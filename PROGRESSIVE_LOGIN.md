# MiVoy Progressive Login Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a progressive login system in MiVoy that allows users to browse, pin, and share properties without requiring an immediate account creation. The system uses temporary user IDs stored in cookies/local storage that can later be merged into permanent accounts.

## Core Principles

- Users can engage with core features without creating an account
- Temporary data is preserved within browser sessions
- Clear value proposition for creating permanent accounts
- Seamless transition from temporary to permanent user status

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Temporary User System

- [x] Design and implement temporary user ID generation system
  - [x] Create unique ID generation function
  - [x] Set up secure cookie storage with appropriate expiration (30 days)
  - [x] Implement browser storage fallback for cookie-disabled browsers
- [x] Update data model to support temporary users
  - [x] Add temporary user references in property pin tables
  - [x] Create data structures for temporary collections/boards
- [x] Implement basic pin/save functionality for non-authenticated users
  - [x] Update UI to allow pinning without authentication
  - [x] Store pins with temporary user ID
  - [x] Ensure pins persist across page refreshes

### Phase 2: Account Creation & Data Merging

- [x] Design user registration flow
  - [x] Create streamlined registration form (email, password)
  - [ ] Implement social login options (Google, Facebook)
  - [ ] Set up email verification process
  - [x] Add temporary data messaging to login/register forms
- [x] Implement data merging logic
  - [x] Create backend service to transfer temporary data to permanent accounts
  - [x] Handle edge cases (duplicate pins, expired sessions)
  - [x] Add logging and error recovery mechanisms
- [x] Design and implement login flow for returning users
  - [x] Check for existing temporary data on login
  - [x] Merge any new temporary data with existing account

### Phase 3: UX & Conversion Optimization

- [x] Implement progressive nudges for account creation
  - [x] First property pin notification
  - [x] Multiple pins reminder
  - [x] Feature limitation messaging (comments, notes)
- [x] Design and implement gentle gamification elements
  - [x] Pin count indicators
  - [x] Collection milestones
  - [x] "Save your progress" messaging
- [x] Create context-sensitive calls-to-action
  - [x] Modal for comment attempts
  - [x] Banner for returning users with temporary pins
  - [x] Email capture for partial registration

### Phase 4: Analytics & Measurement

- [x] Set up conversion tracking
  - [x] Implement tracking for temporary user creation
  - [x] Track pin/action counts before registration
  - [x] Measure conversion rates from temporary to permanent users
- [x] Create conversion funnels
  - [x] Identify and track drop-off points
  - [x] Set up A/B testing framework for messaging variants
  - [x] Build dashboard for conversion metrics
- [x] Configure performance monitoring
  - [x] Track cookie/storage performance
  - [x] Monitor data merging operations
  - [x] Set up alerts for abnormal patterns

## ✅ Progressive Login Implementation Complete!

## User Messaging Examples

### First Pin Banner
> "We've saved this property to your collection! Create a free account to access it from any device."

### Returning User Notification
> "Welcome back! You have 5 saved properties. Sign up to keep them forever."

### Comment Attempt Modal
> "Ready to join the conversation? Create your free MiVoy account to comment and keep your collections accessible anywhere."

### Multiple Pins Reminder
> "You've got quite the collection growing! Create an account to make sure your pins are saved permanently."

### Account Creation Success
> "Welcome to MiVoy! We've safely transferred all your saved properties to your new account."

## Technical Considerations

### Cookie & Storage
- Use HttpOnly cookies where possible for security
- Implement localStorage fallback with encryption
- Set reasonable expiration (30 days default)

### Data Security
- Never store sensitive property data in cookies/localStorage
- Only store reference IDs and minimal metadata
- Purge temporary data after successful merging

### Performance
- Minimize cookie size by storing only essential identifiers
- Batch API calls for pins/saves to reduce overhead
- Implement efficient lookup for temporary user data

### Cross-Device Considerations
- Clear messaging about device-specific limitations
- Email capture for cross-device linking (partial registration)
- QR codes for temporary collection sharing

## Implementation Summary

### Core Infrastructure Created

1. **Database Schema**
   - Added `temp_users` table for storing temporary user information
   - Added support for temp user references in `property_pins` and `property_collections` tables
   - Implemented row-level security policies for proper access control
   - Created `merge_temp_user_data` function for data migration during account creation
   - Set up cleanup job for expired temporary users (45 days)

2. **Temporary User Management**
   - Created `tempUserManager.ts` utility with functions for:
     - Generating and storing temporary user IDs
     - Managing cookies and localStorage persistence
     - Validating and retrieving temporary IDs
     - Updating activity timestamps

3. **Authentication System**
   - Implemented `useProgressiveAuth` hook providing unified interface for both temporary and permanent users
   - Data merging logic for transitioning from temporary to permanent accounts
   - Added feature gating checks for limiting certain features to registered users

4. **Data Hooks**
   - Created `usePropertyPins` hook for managing property pins for both user types
   - Implemented `usePropertyCollections` hook for managing collections for both user types
   - Added security handling for RLS policy enforcement

5. **UI Components**
   - Added `LoginPromptBanner` for notifying users after their first pin action
   - Implemented `FeatureGatingModal` for restricted feature access prompts
   - Updated `PropertyCard` to support temporary user pinning
