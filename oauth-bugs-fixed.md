# OAuth Integration Bug Fixes

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. OAuth Callback URL Mismatch
- **Problem**: Different callback URLs were used in different parts of the application.
- **Fix**: Standardized the callback URL to `/settings/trademe-callback` throughout the application.
- **Files Changed**:
  - `src/services/trademe/trademeAuthService.ts`: Updated to use the correct callback URL
  - `src/routes.tsx`: Added redirect from old callback URL for backward compatibility

### 2. Token Storage and Validation Issues
- **Problem**: OAuth tokens were stored inconsistently and without validation.
- **Fix**: Enhanced token storage with timestamps and validation functions.
- **Files Changed**:
  - `src/utils/storageUtils.ts`: Added new functions for token validation and user ID management

### 3. User ID Handling Issues
- **Problem**: User ID was retrieved inconsistently from localStorage, causing syncing failures.
- **Fix**: Implemented proper user ID retrieval from Supabase auth or fallback to stored ID.
- **Files Changed**:
  - `src/services/trademe/trademePropertyService.ts`: Improved user ID retrieval
  - `src/utils/storageUtils.ts`: Added functions to store, retrieve and clear user ID

### 4. Property Mapping Issues
- **Problem**: The Property type definition didn't include necessary fields for database storage.
- **Fix**: Updated Property interface and mapping functions to include required fields.
- **Files Changed**:
  - `src/types/index.ts`: Added user_id, favorite_date, and last_updated to Property interface
  - `src/utils/propertyMappers.ts`: Updated mapWatchlistItemToProperty to include these fields

### 5. Error Handling in Synchronization
- **Problem**: Limited error handling and retry logic for API/database operations.
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling, retry mechanism, and detailed logging.
- **Files Changed**:
  - `src/services/trademe/trademePropertyService.ts`: Improved error handling and retry logic in syncWatchlistToDatabase

### 6. Special Character Issues
- **Problem**: Function names had special invisible characters causing TypeScript errors.
- **Fix**: Renamed functions to remove special characters.
- **Files Changed**:
  - `src/utils/storageUtils.ts`: Fixed function names
  - Updated all references in various files

## Remaining Issues and Improvements

1. **OAuth Configuration on TradeMe Side**
   - The TradeMe consumer key and secret may need to be registered with the correct callback URL on the TradeMe developer portal.

2. **Error Feedback to Users**
   - More detailed error messages could be shown to users when synchronization fails.

3. **Automatic Token Refresh**
   - The application doesn't currently handle token refreshing automatically. OAuth tokens from TradeMe may expire.

4. **Sync Status Feedback**
   - More detailed progress feedback during synchronization would improve user experience.

## How to Test the Fixes

1. **OAuth Flow Testing**
   - Navigate to the settings page and click 'Connect to TradeMe'
   - Authorize the application on the TradeMe site
   - Verify you're redirected back to the settings page
   - Check that the connection status shows as connected

2. **Synchronization Testing**
   - After connecting, click the 'Sync Watchlist' button
   - Verify properties are correctly imported
   - Check the database for correct user ID associations

3. **Error Handling Testing**
   - Test with invalid credentials to verify error messages
   - Check the console logs for detailed error information
   - Verify the application gracefully handles API failures
