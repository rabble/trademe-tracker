# IndexTemplate Fixes

## Issues Fixed
We identified and fixed several critical issues in the `indexTemplate.ts` file:

1. **Missing Content**: The template was previously returning an empty string or minimal content, causing the site to show just a loading indicator.

2. **Duplicate Code**: The template contained duplicate code in the login form handler, with multiple sections that could cause redirect issues.

3. **JavaScript Fallback**: There was no fallback functionality for when the React application failed to load.

4. **Login Flow**: The login functionality was incomplete, with no proper session management or redirect logic.

5. **Error Handling**: There was minimal error handling and no way for users to identify what was wrong when issues occurred.
