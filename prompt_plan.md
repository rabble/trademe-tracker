# TradeMe Property Tracker: Incremental Development Plan & LLM Prompts

## Development Strategy Overview

This plan breaks down the TradeMe Property Tracker project into small, manageable chunks that build incrementally on each other. Each step produces a testable, working component that contributes to the final product. The steps are designed to:

1. Start with the simplest possible implementation
2. Add complexity gradually
3. Test each component thoroughly before moving on
4. Build a working product at each milestone

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation

### Step 1.1: Initial Project Setup

```
I'm building a TradeMe property tracker web application. Let's start by setting up the basic project structure. I'm using:
- Vite for React setup 
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- Supabase for backend
- TypeScript for type safety

Please create the initial project setup with the following:
1. A proper Vite configuration
2. Tailwind CSS integration
3. Basic TypeScript configuration
4. A simple folder structure (components, hooks, utils, pages, types, services)
5. Essential npm dependencies
6. A basic .gitignore
7. Sample environment variables file (.env.example)

The app should just render a basic "Hello World" page at this stage. Include instructions for how to initialize and run the project.
```

### Step 1.2: Authentication Setup with Supabase

```
Now let's implement user authentication using Supabase Auth. I've already set up the basic project structure in the previous step.

Please create:
1. A Supabase client configuration file
2. React components for:
   - Login form
   - Registration form
   - Password reset
   - A protected route wrapper
3. Authentication hooks for:
   - useAuth (current user, loading state)
   - useLogin
   - useLogout
   - useRegister

Make sure to include proper error handling and loading states. The components should use Tailwind for styling.

Don't worry about integration with the rest of the app yet - we'll just need standalone components that work with Supabase Auth.
```

### Step 1.3: Basic Layout and Navigation

```
Let's create the basic layout and navigation for the TradeMe property tracker app. We already have authentication set up with Supabase.

Please create:
1. A main layout component with:
   - Header with app name and user menu (showing login/logout)
   - Sidebar for navigation
   - Main content area
   - Responsive design using Tailwind

2. Basic navigation components:
   - Navigation links in the sidebar
   - User dropdown menu in header

3. Basic pages:
   - Dashboard (empty for now)
   - Properties (empty for now)
   - Settings (empty placeholder)

4. Navigation using React Router:
   - Define routes for each page
   - Protect routes that require authentication
   - Redirect to login when accessing protected routes without authentication

The focus here is on creating a working navigation shell that we'll populate with actual content in future steps.
```

## Phase 2: Database & API Layer

### Step 2.1: Supabase Database Schema

```
Let's set up the Supabase database schema for our TradeMe property tracker. Based on our specification, we need to track properties, images, listing history, and user views.

Please create SQL migration files for the following tables:

1. properties - Main property information
2. property_images - Images for each property
3. property_listings - Historical data about listing changes
4. property_views - User view tracking

Include appropriate indexes, constraints, and relationships between tables. Also include RLS (Row Level Security) policies to ensure users can only access their own data.

The schema should match what we specified in the technical specification document, with appropriate data types, constraints, and relationships.

Also, create a TypeScript interface file for each table schema to be used in our React application.
```

### Step 2.2: API Service Layer

```
Now let's create the API service layer for our TradeMe property tracker. We need to build service functions that interact with our Supabase database.

Please create the following service modules:

1. PropertyService:
   - fetchProperties(filters): Get properties with pagination and filtering
   - fetchPropertyById(id): Get a single property with full details
   - updateProperty(id, data): Update user notes or other fields
   - archiveProperty(id): Mark a property as archived (not physically delete)

2. ImageService:
   - fetchPropertyImages(propertyId): Get all images for a property
   - fetchImageHistory(propertyId): Get historical images for a property

3. AnalyticsService:
   - fetchSummary(): Get portfolio summary statistics
   - fetchRecentChanges(): Get recent property changes
   - fetchInsights(): Get property insights

Each service should:
- Use the Supabase client we've already set up
- Include proper error handling
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Include JSDoc comments for documentation
- Return data in a consistent format

Don't implement the actual scraping logic yet - just the services that will interact with our database.
```

### Step 2.3: React Query Integration

```
Let's integrate React Query into our TradeMe property tracker to manage server state. We need to create hooks that wrap around our API service functions from the previous step.

Please create the following custom hooks:

1. Property hooks:
   - useProperties(filters): For fetching properties with filters
   - useProperty(id): For fetching a single property
   - useUpdateProperty(): For updating property data
   - useArchiveProperty(): For archiving a property

2. Image hooks:
   - usePropertyImages(propertyId): For fetching property images
   - useImageHistory(propertyId): For fetching image history

3. Analytics hooks:
   - useSummary(): For fetching summary statistics
   - useRecentChanges(): For fetching recent changes
   - useInsights(): For fetching insights

Each hook should:
- Use React Query's useQuery or useMutation as appropriate
- Handle loading, error, and success states
- Include proper TypeScript typing
- Implement appropriate caching strategies
- Include refetch functionality where needed

Also, create a QueryProvider component that wraps the app with React Query's QueryClientProvider.
```

## Phase 3: UI Component Development

### Step 3.1: Property Card Component

```
Let's create the Property Card component for our TradeMe property tracker. This will be a key UI element displayed in the grid view.

Please create a PropertyCard component that:

1. Displays a property with:
   - Main property image
   - Address
   - Key details (bedrooms, bathrooms, land area)
   - Current price
   - Days on market
   - Status indicator (active, under offer, sold)
   - Visual indicator for price changes

2. Includes interactions:
   - Click to view full property details
   - Quick action buttons (archive, notes)

3. Has different visual states for:
   - New listings (added in last 7 days)
   - Price drops
   - Status changes

The component should use Tailwind CSS for styling, be fully responsive, and include skeleton loading states for when data is being fetched.

Also create a simple PropertyCardGrid component that displays multiple PropertyCard components in a responsive grid.
```

### Step 3.2: Property Table Component

```
Now let's create the Property Table component for our TradeMe property tracker. This will provide a data-focused alternative to the card view.

Please create a PropertyTable component that:

1. Displays properties in a table format with columns for:
   - Property image (thumbnail)
   - Address
   - Property type
   - Bedrooms/bathrooms
   - Land area
   - Current price
   - Previous price
   - Days on market
   - Status
   - Last updated

2. Includes functionality for:
   - Sorting by any column
   - Resizable columns
   - Pagination
   - Row selection

3. Has visual indicators for:
   - Price changes (up/down arrows with color)
   - Status changes
   - New listings

The table should be built using a combination of custom components with Tailwind CSS. It should be responsive, with a sensible approach to handling narrow screens (either horizontal scrolling or column hiding).

Include a TableControls component above the table with options for page size, sorting, and view toggling.
```

### Step 3.3: Property Details Page

```
Let's create the Property Details page for our TradeMe property tracker. This page will show comprehensive information about a single property.

Please create a PropertyDetailsPage component that:

1. Displays detailed property information:
   - Image gallery with large photos
   - Full property details (all fields from our database)
   - Price history chart using Recharts
   - Full property description
   - Agent/agency information
   - Status history

2. Includes interactive elements:
   - Image gallery navigation
   - Tab navigation between different sections (Details, History, Similar Properties)
   - User notes editor
   - Back button to return to the property list

3. Shows related data:
   - Similar properties section
   - AI-generated insights about the property (placeholder for now)

The page should use React Router's useParams to get the property ID from the URL, and then use our existing useProperty hook to fetch the data.

Ensure the page has proper loading states, error handling, and a responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
```

### Step 3.4: Map View Component

```
Let's create the Map View component for our TradeMe property tracker. This will provide a geographical visualization of saved properties.

Please create a MapView component using React-Leaflet and OpenStreetMap that:

1. Displays all properties as markers on the map with:
   - Custom markers for different property types
   - Clustering for properties in the same area
   - Pop-up information on marker click

2. Includes controls for:
   - Zoom in/out
   - Centering the map
   - Toggling between map layers

3. Interacts with other components:
   - Clicking a marker shows brief property details
   - Option to open full property details page from popup
   - Filters applied to the property list also affect the map

The component should handle error states gracefully, show loading indicators, and be responsive for different screen sizes. Include proper TypeScript typing for all components.

Also create a simple PropertyMapCard component for the pop-up information display that shows a compact version of the property information.
```

### Step 3.5: Filter and Search Components

```
Now let's create the filter and search components for our TradeMe property tracker. These will allow users to narrow down the properties they're viewing.

Please create the following components:

1. SearchBar component:
   - Text input for searching by address or description
   - Immediate filtering as the user types (debounced)
   - Clear button to reset search

2. FilterPanel component with filters for:
   - Price range (min/max sliders)
   - Property type (checkboxes)
   - Bedrooms/bathrooms (numeric selectors)
   - Land/floor area (range sliders)
   - Property status (active, under offer, sold)
   - Days on market (range slider)
   - Listing type (auction, price by negotiation, etc.)

3. ActiveFilters component:
   - Shows all currently active filters as tags
   - Ability to remove individual filters
   - Clear all filters button

4. SavedFilters component:
   - Save current filter configuration
   - Load saved filters
   - Delete saved filters

These components should use Tailwind for styling and include proper TypeScript typing. They should connect to our existing state management (React Query) and trigger refetching when filters change.

Make sure the filters are responsive and collapse/expand appropriately on mobile screens.
```

### Step 3.6: Analytics Dashboard Components

```
Let's create the analytics dashboard components for our TradeMe property tracker. These will visualize aggregate data about the tracked properties.

Please create the following components using Recharts:

1. PropertySummaryStats:
   - Total properties tracked
   - Active vs. sold properties
   - Average days on market
   - Average price
   - Properties with price drops

2. PriceHistoryChart:
   - Line chart showing price trends over time
   - Toggle between average price and individual properties
   - Time period selector (1m, 3m, 6m, 1y, all)

3. StatusDistributionChart:
   - Pie or bar chart showing distribution of property statuses
   - Filterable by property type

4. PropertyTypesChart:
   - Bar chart showing distribution of property types
   - Compare count vs. average price

5. TimeOnMarketChart:
   - Histogram showing distribution of days on market
   - Compare different property types or regions

Each chart should:
- Have a loading state
- Handle empty data gracefully
- Be responsive to different screen sizes
- Include proper tooltips and legends
- Use a consistent color scheme

Also create a DashboardLayout component that arranges these charts in a responsive grid.
```

## Phase 4: Web Scraping Implementation

### Step 4.1: Cloudflare Worker Setup

```
Let's set up the Cloudflare Worker environment for our TradeMe property tracker. This will handle our API and scraping functionality.

Please create:

1. A basic Cloudflare Worker setup with:
   - wrangler.toml configuration
   - TypeScript support
   - Environment variable handling
   - Basic routing structure

2. API routes for:
   - Properties endpoints (GET /api/properties, GET /api/properties/:id, etc.)
   - Analytics endpoints (GET /api/analytics/summary, etc.)
   - Authentication middleware

3. A scheduled trigger for the daily scraping job:
   - CRON syntax for daily execution at 3:00 AM NZT
   - Basic scraper function skeleton (implementation to come later)

4. Error handling middleware:
   - Standardized error responses
   - Logging setup
   - Rate limiting protection

Please don't implement the actual scraping logic yet, just the Worker framework and routing that will contain it.

Include instructions for local development and testing using Miniflare or wrangler dev.
```

### Step 4.2: Basic Scraper Implementation

```
Now let's implement the basic scraping functionality for our TradeMe property tracker. This will run on our Cloudflare Worker to extract property data from TradeMe.

Please create:

1. A Playwright-based scraper module with:
   - TradeMe login functionality
   - Navigation to the favorites page
   - Extraction of the list of favorited properties

2. Property data extraction for:
   - Basic property details from the favorites page
   - Full property details by visiting each listing page
   - Image URLs for all property photos

3. Data processing functions:
   - Cleanup and normalization of scraped data
   - Mapping to our database schema
   - Basic change detection compared to existing data

4. Error handling and resilience:
   - Retry logic for failed requests
   - Timeout handling
   - Session expiration detection and relogin

This implementation should be able to run within Cloudflare Workers' limits. Don't worry about image downloading and storage yet - we'll implement that in the next step.

Please include comments explaining any potential issues or limitations with this approach, particularly regarding Workers' runtime constraints.
```

### Step 4.3: Image Handling in Scraper

```
Let's enhance our TradeMe property tracker scraper to handle property images. We need to download images from TradeMe and store them in Supabase Storage.

Please implement:

1. Image extraction and processing:
   - Extract high-resolution image URLs from property pages
   - Handle different image formats and sizes
   - Track image order/sequence

2. Supabase Storage integration:
   - Create a consistent folder structure (property_id/date/image_number)
   - Upload images to Supabase Storage
   - Handle rate limiting and chunking for multiple images

3. Image change detection:
   - Compare new images with previously stored ones
   - Only download/store new or changed images
   - Keep track of removed images

4. Optimization strategies:
   - Parallel uploads where appropriate
   - Caching of already processed images
   - Handling of Cloudflare Worker limitations

This implementation should work within the constraints of Cloudflare Workers, using strategies like chunking or queuing if necessary to handle the potentially large amount of image data.

Include error handling for cases where images fail to download or upload, ensuring the rest of the property data is still processed correctly.
```

### Step 4.4: Change Tracking Implementation

```
Let's implement change tracking for our TradeMe property tracker. We need to detect and record changes to property listings over time.

Please create:

1. Change detection functions:
   - Compare newly scraped data with existing database records
   - Identify changes in price, description, status, or listing method
   - Calculate significance of changes (e.g., percentage price drop)

2. Database update functions:
   - Create new property_listings records for changes
   - Update the main properties table with current values
   - Handle the creation of new properties for first-time favorites

3. Historical tracking:
   - Record complete property data at each snapshot
   - Store full listing descriptions for historical reference
   - Track agent/agency changes

4. Status change handling:
   - Special logic for tracking status changes (e.g., "For Sale" to "Under Offer")
   - Detection of sold properties
   - Handling of withdrawn listings

The implementation should be efficient, only storing actual changes rather than daily snapshots when nothing has changed. Include detailed comments explaining the change detection logic and how it handles edge cases.

Make sure the functions work with the constraints of Cloudflare Workers and integrate with our existing scraper implementation.
```

### Step 4.5: Scraper Testing and Monitoring

```
Let's create a comprehensive testing and monitoring solution for our TradeMe property tracker scraper. We need to ensure it runs reliably and detect issues early.

Please implement:

   - Metrics collection (properties scraped, images processed, etc.)
   - Alerting for critical failures

3. Resilience improvements:
   - Circuit breaker pattern for handling TradeMe rate limiting
   - Gradual backoff for retries
   - Partial success handling

4. Debug mode:
   - Detailed logging option for troubleshooting
   - Visual debugging helpers (e.g., screenshots of problematic pages)
   - Dry-run capability that doesn't modify the database

The implementation should work within Cloudflare Workers, possibly using Workers KV for some state storage related to monitoring. Include a strategy for detecting when TradeMe changes their site structure, which would require scraper updates.

Also include a simple dashboard component for the frontend that shows scraper health status and recent run statistics.
```

## Phase 5: AI Integration

### Step 5.1: Claude API Integration

3. SearchPatternAnalysis:
   - Track changes in user preferences over time
   - Identify when users are broadening or narrowing their search
   - Recognize shifts in priority (e.g., from location to price)

4. AI Insights component for the frontend:
   - Display preference analysis visually
   - Show recommendation highlights
   - Present insights in an accessible, actionable format

The implementation should balance privacy considerations while providing genuinely useful insights. Ensure the analysis doesn't make assumptions beyond what the data supports, and provide confidence levels for insights where appropriate.

Include strategies for handling sparse data (few favorited properties) and for regularly updating the analysis as new properties are favorited.
```

### Step 5.4: AI Insights Dashboard

```
Let's create the AI Insights dashboard for our TradeMe property tracker. This will provide a user-friendly interface for viewing the AI-generated insights about properties and preferences.

   - Versioning strategy

4. Monitoring and improvement plan:
   - User analytics review schedule
   - Performance optimization targets
   - Error rate reduction goals
   - Resource utilization tracking

The plan should be realistic and sustainable, with clear priorities and responsibilities. Include guidelines for making decisions about bug fixes versus new features, and criteria for prioritizing technical debt.

Also include a strategy for keeping up with external changes, such as updates to the TradeMe website structure or changes to the Cloudflare Workers platform.
