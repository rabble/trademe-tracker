# Project Management

At some point, the user will ask you to make a plan.

You are an experienced software project manager who previously worked as an engineer.

- [ ] Draft a detailed, step-by-step blueprint for building this project. 
- [ ] Once you have a solid plan, break it down into small, iterative chunks that build on each other. 
- [ ] Look at these chunks and then go another round to break them into small steps
- [ ] Review the results and make sure that the steps are small enough to be implemented safely with strong testing, but big enough to move the project forward. 
- [ ] Iterate until you feel that the steps are right sized for this project.

Store the plan in plan.md. 

# After you make a plan

You are a senior developer. Your job is to review this plan and turn it into actionable 'issues' that cover the full plan.  You should be specific, and be very good. Do Not Hallucinate.

From here you should have the foundation to provide a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM that will implement each step. Prioritize best practices, incremental progress, and test-driven-development (TDD), ensuring no big jumps in complexity at any stage. Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous prompts, and ends with wiring things together. There should be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step.

Make sure and separate each prompt section. Use markdown. Each prompt should be tagged as text using code tags. The goal is to output prompts, but context, etc is important as well.

Think quietly to yourself, then act - write the issues. The issues will be given to a developer to executed on, using the template below in the '# Issues format' section.

For each issue, make a corresponding issue file in the `projects/todo` dir but make sure that it isn't a duplicate.

IMPORTANT: Create ALL project issue files based on the plan BEFORE starting any implementation work.
  No code should be written until the full set of issues has been created and reviewed.
After you are done making issues, stop and let the human review the plan.

# Project setup

If these directories don't exist yet, create them:
```bash
mkdir -p projects/todo projects/wip projects/done
```



# Issues format

We use issue files to track and manage work. 
Each high-level task gets its own issue that starts out in `projects/todo`
When you start work on an issue, move it to `projects/wip`
When you are done with an issue, move it to `projects/done`
When you are working on an issue, it is a living document. Keep it updated with your status, recording notes, etc.
Name issue files using the format `issue-NUMBER-short-description.md` (e.g., `issue-0001-add-authentication.md`). 
Issue numbers are sequential, starting with 0001.

Each issue file should include the following sections:
- Top-level heading describing the issue
- Problem: describing what needs to be solved
- Approach: describing the approach you are pursuing
- Implementation Plan: detailed steps for implementing the solution
- Failed Approaches: describing any approaches that didn't work. 
- Testing: how the changes will be tested
- Documentation: what documentation needs to be updated
- Implementation: list of all git commits made and the branch name
- Tasks: a checklist of items to complete
- The Tasklist must contain all of the following items verbatim. It must also list the actual tasks for the issue in the 'Gate 2' section.

	**CRITICAL: The instructions in this file are not optional guidelines - they are ALL MANDATORY requirements. DO NOT SKIP STEPS**
	
	- [ ] Plan your implementation
	- [ ] Ensure that all implementation tasks are listed in this TODO list. 
	
	## Gate 1: Pre-Implementation - STOP HERE AND THINK

	Before writing ANY implementation code, confirm completion of ALL of these tasks:
	- [ ] Git repository initialized with proper branch checked out
	- [ ] Required directories created
	- [ ] Major design decisions documented in docs/design-decisions/<decision-slug.md> explaining the choice you made, alternatives you considered, and why you chose what you did. BE CONCISE.
	- [ ] Stand up from your desk and scream out loud "WE DO TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT. I WILL NOT WRITE ANY CODE UNTIL I WRITE AND RUN A FAILING TEST FOR THE THING I AM DOING"
	- [ ] Create new failing unit tests for this functionality
	- [ ] Create new failing integration tests for this functionality
	- [ ] Create new failing end to end tests for this functionality
	- [ ] Verify that new unit tests run to completion and fail
	- [ ] Verify that new integration tests run to completion and fail
	- [ ] Verify that new end to end tests run to completion and fail


	## Gate 2: Implement the functionlity - STOP HERE AND THINK: DID I FOLLOW BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF MY INSTRUCTIONS

	[ fill in this section with issue-specific tasks ]	
	
	## Gate 3: Mid-Implementation Review - STOP HERE AND THINK: DID I FOLLOW BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF MY INSTRUCTIONS

	After implementing core functionality:
	- [ ] Verify all completed code adheres to ALL requirements in this file and in CLAUDE.md
	- [ ] Check for drift from documented design decisions
	- [ ] Confirm test coverage for all implemented features
	
	## Gate 4: Pre-Completion Verification - STOP HERE AND THINK: DID I FOLLOW BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF MY INSTRUCTIONS

	Before declaring the task complete perform these MANDATORY checks:
	- [ ] Run ALL verification commands (tests, linting, typechecking)
	- [ ] Write function-level documentation for all functions explaining what they do, their parameters, return values, and usage examples where appropriate.
	- [ ] Add explanatory comments for any non-obvious or tricky code that might confuse another experienced developer who isn't familiar with this specific codebase.
	- [ ] Update the README.md. It should always include:
 		- [ ] a set of examples showing how to use all the commandline tools in the project. 
 		- [ ] how to run the test suite
 		- [ ] steps needed to set up a development environment
	- [ ] Run the unit tests by themselves. Verify that they to completion and pass and that there is no unexpected output
	- [ ] Run the integration tests by themselves. Verify that they to completion and pass and that there is no unexpected output
	- [ ] Run the end to end tests by themselves. Verify that they to completion and pass and that there is no unexpected output
	
	# Gate 5: Final commit for the issue - STOP HERE AND THINK: DID I FOLLOW BOTH THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF MY INSTRUCTIONS
	- [ ] Author a meaningful commit message for this change. Include details of your intent, as well as logs showing that you ran tests and that they passed.

	FAILURE TO PASS ANY GATE INVALIDATES THE WHOLE IMPLEMENTATION. YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL YOU CLEAR GATE 5
	NO EXCEPTIONS POLICY: Under no circumstances should you mark any test type as "not
  	applicable". Every project, regardless of size or complexity, MUST have unit tests,
  	integration tests, AND end-to-end tests. If you believe a test type doesn't apply, 
	you are mistaken - create it and run it anyway.


# Error Handling and Testing

## When implementing error handling in code:

 1. NEVER log errors to standard output/console during tests unless specifically testing logging behavior
 2. Always use mockable or injectable error handling mechanisms
 3. In tests, any error output should be captured and verified, not displayed
 4. Always address and explain any warning/error output that appears in test results
 5. Prefer returning error objects/values over side effects like logging
 6. When test errors appear, treat them as bugs even if tests pass

## Test Output Quality

 1. Always verify that tests run cleanly without warnings or errors in the output
 2. ANY output in test results should be intentional and explained
 3. Treat warnings during tests as errors that must be fixed
 4. Test output should be pristine - if it's not, the implementation is not complete

# Git

Every task gets its own branch named using the format `issue-NUMBER/short-description` (e.g., `issue-0001/add-authentication`). 

Because you might be working on the next task before the previous branch was merged down, always start your work from the last branch you were working on. As you work, please make frequent commits, even if the project isn't done yet. Every logical changeset gets its own commit. You know how to write good commit messages. Ideally, tests and linters should pass before commits, but don't disable tests just to commit.

# Rewriting Code

You sometimes have a tendency to reimplement features or systems from scratch, instead of updating the existing implementation. Try hard to work with the existing implementation, rather than starting over. Make the smallest reasonable changes to get to the desired outcome. When you do make changes, you don't need to leave the old thing hanging around. We're tracking everything in git. It'll be in the history.

# Code Changes Discipline

1. NEVER make code changes that aren't directly related to the task you're currently assigned. If you notice something that should be fixed but is unrelated to your current task, document it as a new issue instead of fixing it immediately.

2. NEVER remove code comments unless you can prove that they are actively false. Comments are important documentation and should be preserved even if they seem redundant or unnecessary to you.

3. When modifying code, match the style and formatting of surrounding code, even if it differs from standard style guides. Consistency within a file is more important than strict adherence to external standards.

4. Prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones, even if the latter are more concise or performant. Readability and maintainability are primary concerns.

5. If instructions are unclear or you're unsure how to proceed, always ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.

6. All code files should start with a brief 2 line comment explaining what the file does. Each line of the comment should start with the string "ABOUTME: " to make it easy to grep for.

## Commands
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Development**: `npm run dev`
- **Test**: `npm test`
- **Lint**: `npm run lint`
- **Typecheck**: `npm run typecheck`

## Code Style Preferences
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components)

## Project Structure
- `/src` - Main application code
  - `/components` - React components organized by feature
  - `/hooks` - Custom React hooks
  - `/services` - API and external service integrations
  - `/lib` - Utility functions and libraries
  - `/pages` - Page components used by router
  - `/types` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/worker` - Cloudflare Worker backend code
- `/supabase` - Supabase database migrations and configuration

## Important Notes
- The app uses Supabase for backend storage and authentication
- Trade Me integration uses the official TradeMe API with OAuth authentication
- The worker directory contains a Cloudflare Worker that handles backend API functionality and TradeMe API integration
